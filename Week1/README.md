# Week 1 - Induction Week

## Overview

This week covered the basics of the use of Markdown, Windows PowerShell (though I used a Macintosh for this), Visual Studio, Powershell Scripting, Git, GitHub & very basic C#. At the end of the week, Agile and Scrum was covered, including scrum related techniques.

## C# Introduction Solution

This program dealt with basic program creation, debugging tool such as breakpoints, & console C#

The project is a console application, and is called within the console terminal.

## Agile, Scrum & Wireframing

The latter part of the week required the use of the SCRUM system for dealing with a small project (without coding), to create a prototype wireframe.
